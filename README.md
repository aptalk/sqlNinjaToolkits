## A Tiny Treasure Trove of SQL Sorcery
Just a small—but mighty—selection of queries and scripts that’ll make your SQL Server bow to your every admin whim. Whether you're taming rogue indexes, interrogating your database like it's on trial, or just trying to remember that one command you always Google—this stash has your back. Use wisely, laugh occasionally, and may your SELECTs always be fast and your WHEREs never too vague.
